# Data-Table

DataTables has the ability to read data from virtually any JSON data source that can be obtained by Ajax. 
This can be done, in its most simple form, by setting the ajax option to the address of the JSON data source.

The ajax option also allows for more advanced configuration such as altering how the Ajax request is made.
